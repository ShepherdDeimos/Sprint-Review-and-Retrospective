How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?


User stories are essential tools in helping to interpret user needs. They break down complex user
requirements into smaller, actionable tasks. By using user stories, I can prioritize features based on
user value, ensuring that the development process is user-centered. Each user story allows me to
focus on specific user actions or goals, making it easier to implement functionalities that directly
align with user needs.


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


In developing programs, I follow an iterative approach guided by Agile principles. I believe in
breaking work into smaller, manageable sprints to allow for continuous delivery and adaptation. In
my future work, I plan to incorporate Agile processes like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and
retrospectives to maintain clear communication, track progress, and reflect on improvements. These
practices ensure that the development process is adaptable and user-focused.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?


A good team member in software development is someone who is collaborative, communicative,
and committed to team success. It’s important to contribute regularly during sprints, provide
feedback in retrospectives, and be adaptable to changes. Being supportive of teammates, sharing
progress transparently, and proactively solving problems are all critical aspects of being an effective
team member.
